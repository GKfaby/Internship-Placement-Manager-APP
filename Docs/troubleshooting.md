Understanding the ErrorThe error AttributeError: module 'bcrypt' has no attribute '__about__' indicates a version incompatibility between the passlib and bcrypt libraries. Your application, specifically the password hashing function, uses passlib which, in turn, tries to access a version-specific attribute from bcrypt that has been removed in the newer bcrypt versions.The 400 Bad Request ErrorThis error means the data you sent to the server was invalid or malformed. The create_student endpoint expects a JSON payload that matches the StudentCreate model, which requires specific keys and data types.Correct JSON Payload Example:

{
  "full_name": "Naruto Uzumaki",
  "email": "naruto.uzumaki@konoha.com",
  "major": "Ninjutsu",
  "password": "my_secret_password"
}

Make sure your request body is structured exactly like this, with all four keys present and spelled correctly.How the New Files Fix Itrequirements.txt Changes: I have updated your requirements.txt file to specify exact versions for passlib and bcrypt that are known to be compatible (passlib==1.7.4 and bcrypt==3.2.0). This prevents your system from installing an incompatible version of bcrypt.src/routers/students.py Changes: Although not directly related to the error, I have added a print() statement in the create_student function. This will help you confirm that the password is being hashed correctly when you test the endpoint.Next StepsSave the updated requirements.txt file.Save the updated src/routers/students.py file.Run pip install -r requirements.txt to install the correct dependency versions.Restart your Uvicorn server.
